<p>When creating your tree, use the DB patch to store your passwords. Information should be stored in key-value format only. So every entry will have one â€œkeyâ€ and one â€œvalue; and therefore, for credentials, there will be atleast 2 entries in the DB, whose keys will be of the form â€œcredentials-quaker-usernameâ€ and â€œcredentials-quaker-passwordâ€</p>

<p><strong>Do not store credentials in your trees</strong></p>
