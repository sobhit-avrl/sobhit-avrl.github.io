title: The New Tree Life-cycle for an FDE
---

Updated 15/7

When an FDE needs to start working on a tree (a non Boomerang tree), the following steps need to be followed:
+ Log into templates.avrlgeneration.com
+ Check if the target is present in the list of trees. Naming format is:
    - \<lb/ta\>_\<tms\>_\<accountname\>{_\<option2/3/4\>}
+ If the target tree you were looking for:
    - IS PRESENT in the templates account, open it <br>
    **Do not open trees that have an "option2" or "option3" suffix, those are created only to serve a temporary need and have already been allocated to someone!**

    - IS NOT PRESENT in the templates account, ask the approvers for a clone and open it when they grants you one <br>
    **The templates account is special, if you create a clone in templates, it every single studio user of templates automatically gets access and you do not have to add a separate access request in the requester**

+ When you open the tree, check the root node to see if there is another FDE's name in it. If there:

    - IS A NAME present, it means that someone else is using this tree. You will need an option2 clone. Ask the approvers for this.

    - IS NO NAME present, it means that this tree is usable by you, **you must put your name in the root node to ensure that anyone else looking at the tree knows it is being edited by you and doesn't edit it themselves**

+ Now you can start working on your tree
