Updated 07/15


+ Lowercase with hyphens for keys

+ Should start with "credentials", the second term should be a unique identifier for that board, but doesn't need to list the customer name, the third term should list what kind of value it contains (examples: username, password, sessionkey, apikey, token, etc.)
