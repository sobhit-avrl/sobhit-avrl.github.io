Studio credentials should **always** end in "studio", and should be the person's initials at the start. If the initials overlap with someone else's initials, add an incrementing 2-digit counter to the initials starting at 01.

<span style="color:green">Correct: vrstudio, vr02studio</span>

<span style="color:red">Wrong: vikashranjanstudio, vrstudio2, vrstudio02</span>

Consumer credentials should always end in "consumer" and should be the person's initials at the start. If the initials overlap with someone else's initials, add an incrementing 2-digit counter to the initials, starting at 01.

<span style="color:green">Correct: vr02consumer</span>

<span style="color:red">Wrong: vikashranjanconsumer, vrconsumer2, vrconsumer02</span>

Unattended bots should start with a "ua" prefix, followed by a descriptor and then a "consumer" postfix. No words should follow the "consumer" part.

<span style="color:green">Correct: uaconsumer, ua02consumer, uawarehouseconsumer</span>

<span style="color:red">Wrong: unattendedconsumer, uaconsumerdevavrl, ca_test</span>
