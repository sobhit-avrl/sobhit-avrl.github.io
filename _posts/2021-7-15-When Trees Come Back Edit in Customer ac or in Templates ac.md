title: When Trees Come Back Edit in Customer a/c or in Templates a/c
---

Updated 15/7

There are two types of trees that may return to us:
+ Boomerang Trees are trees which are given to a client, but end up being returned to the FDE because there is an issue with the tree. 
+ Sometimes, clients reach out to us to make changes to a tree that had been built a while ago.

In both these cases, the process for deciding where the modification is to be performed will rely on a simple test:

For the change being requested, where is the need arising from? 

+ from the board logic? 
    i.e. wrong XPATH used or incorrect information being picked up?
+ from business logic? 
    i.e. the customer wants certain dates picked up or has a new API or API structure for their data

If it is coming from board logic, then this means that the template needs to be updated and so please request Ashwin to clone the tree to the templates folder (no option suffix) to overwrite the current template, so that changes can be made there.

If it is coming from business logic, then all changes should be made inside their customer accounts on the Studio.
